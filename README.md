Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Fatima Rahimi, I go by Rose. I am junior computer Science student at Bard college. 
My passion for computer science isnâ€™t limited to just one area. I enjoy exploring a wide range of topics, from statistical simulations and network security to penetration testing and hardware systems. Whether Iâ€™m building a simulation from scratch, analyzing system vulnerabilities, or understanding how components interact at the hardware level, Iâ€™m drawn to the challenge of solving complex, real-world problems through code and experimentation.

- ðŸ”­ Currently developing the game logic and UI for Wordle and spelling bee using JAVA.
