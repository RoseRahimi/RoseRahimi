Hi there 👋

I’m Fatima (Rose) Rahimi, a senior Computer Science student at Bard College with a strong interest in how quantitative research and technology come together to solve real world problems. I enjoy working across different layers of a system thinking about how models behave at the portfolio level, while also digging into the engineering details that make them accurate, reliable, and reproducible.

I’ve built tools for quantitative researchers during my internship at Man Numeric, including automated testing pipelines, DAG-based monitoring systems, and workflow validation tools. I’m currently developing my senior thesis: a three part alpha generation pipeline integrating neural feature extraction, agentic AI signal evaluation, and backtesting them on historical data.

Outside of academics, I’m a student athlete and competitive swimmer. Training has taught me discipline, consistency, and how to push through difficult problems, qualities I carry into engineering and research.

I love learning, building, and helping others get unstuck. Feel free to browse my projects!
