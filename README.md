Hi there 👋

I am Fatima Rahimi, I go by Rose. I am a senior computer Science student at Bard college. 
I’m interested in how quantitative research and technology can come together to solve real world problems. I like working at different levels, thinking about how a model behaves at the portfolio level, and also digging into the details of how it’s implemented to make sure it’s accurate and robust.

Outside of academics, I’m a student-athlete and competitive swimmer. Training has taught me discipline, focus, and how to push through setbacks, qualities I carry into my technical and research work. Some of my best ideas come during long laps in the pool or quiet moments outdoors with a notebook and tea.

I enjoy learning, collaborating, and helping others get unstuck.
